# YOLOv8 Local Training (1-Day Project)

This repo contains a complete YOLOv8 object detection training workflow using a local dataset (no Roboflow API key needed).

## What it does:
- Trains a YOLOv8 model locally using a manually prepared dataset
- Uses Python + Ultralytics + NVIDIA GPU acceleration
- Produces predictions and saves trained weights to `runs/`

## How to run:
1. `python train.py`
2. `python inference.py`
